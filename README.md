# intercourse-rs

This repo is the technical backbone of a presentation about core Rust
conceptsâ€”concepts I would call for when working in another language. The repo
contains a number of individual crates that are organized in a cargo workspace.
Together they should exemplify the concepts.

This README.md introduces the aforementioned concepts on an abstract level and
references the crates for exemplification. In some placesâ€”and I beg for
forgivenessâ€”I will compare examples to corresponding equivalent golang
implementations.

# Installing Rust

Make sure you have rust and cargo
[installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on your system.

Once you have cargo installed, you can run general commands like `cargo clippy`,
`cargo test`, or `cargo build` in the root directory and run the linter, the
test or the build is executed for all contained crates.

_For example_:
```console
intercourse-rs/ $ cargo build
...
     Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.60s
```

If you want to run a binary of a specific crate, you can either specify the
crate name when calling `cargo run --bin <crate_name>` from the root directory,
or switch into the corresponding crate directory and just run `cargo run` there.
The crate name is specified in the `Cargo.toml` of the respective crate.

```console
# the following two commands yield equivalent results
intercourse-rs/ $ cargo run --bin <crate_name>
intercourse-rs/ $ pushd <dir_of_crate>; cargo run --bin <crate_name>; popd
```

## Why Rust ...

*sigh*

> You don't know a programming language â€” unless you *hate* it ... ðŸ˜‰
>
> â€” *yours truly*

You can trust me on one thing: Rust can be a nasty. And especially in areas
where I myself was the customer (e.g. CI), I sometimes found myself thinking:
_Jesus, I don't wanna bother with concurrent memory management right now; just
give me a high-level, functional, GC-collected language already!_

But just as the grass is always greener on the other side, you only truly learn
what something is worth after you lose it. Rust is not my favorite programming
languageâ€”it seems unwise to even have one. However, under specific constraints,
I'm willing to make strong bets.  And one of these strong bets is the following:
If my Â«bread and butterÂ» boils down to delivering and maintaining mission
critical components of (distributed) systems, Rust is my first (and currently
only) choice. Specifically: _I make mistakes. I prefer to make my mistakes in
Rust. And here is why ..._

## The theory ...

Using expressive, strong type systems one can typically reveal defects at an
_early_ stage of the implementation; defects which would otherwise Â«slip
throughÂ» and potentially cause havoc at runtime. However, the fact that we can
check consistency mechanically is only part of the story: strong types not only
provide more accurate information about _what_ we want to the compiler, but also
to ourselves _and others_. As a result, in my experience, many potential issues
become obvious already at the _modeling stage_â€”and thus _before_ we run the type
checker even the first time.

For a simple example: Rust does not allow you to just share pointers across
threads and the type system makes that obvious. If you want to have a smart
pointer, you have to decide whether it is just reference-counted (`Rc`) or
atomically reference-counted (`Arc`). The type system asks you, so to speak,
_are you sure you don't want to share across threads?_

There is a limit to everything and type-sophistication is _also_ a way to make
reviewers' livesâ€”let's sayâ€”interesting. But strong types generally reduce the
risk of misunderstandings between engineers. And I'm sorry for being provocative
here, but especially the latter point I cannot stress enough when claims come up
about how certain Â«simpleÂ» programming languages are supposedly making the lives
of reviewers comparatively more pleasant.

To further elaborate on this point, imho, what it feels like to write code in a
programming language is really _secondary_ to another question: _How quickly can
I convince myself that a specific property holds for a given code?_ To give an
extreme example: while the experience of _writing_ Python code is quite
pleasant, the experience of operationalizing it and taking responsibility for
the reliability of a shipped/deployed system component written in Python is
anything but pleasant.

Conversely, in Rust, at the moment you write some code, you might be annoyed
that you need to decide, e.g., Â«`Arc` or `Rc`?Â», when that seemingly has nothing
to do with the problem you are trying to solve. But in the long run, _others_
(including your _future self_) will highly appreciate the fact that this
decision is _clearly documented_ and the consequences of it are statically and
mechanically enforced. And this is even more true if, later on, that decision
turns out to be the wrong: the type system prevents you from violating prior
assumptions.

## Why it matters: Engineering must scale ...

> Conventions don't scale.
>
> â€” Bjarne Stroustrup, [Â«Delivering Safe C++Â»](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8UvQKvOSSw), Keynote CppCon'23

In a team, you might agree on certain conventions, but that only gets you so
far. Teams change and engineers are under pressure to deliver features. They
don't get all the decisions right when they _create_ new components and APIs,
and they must be prevented from making faulty assumptions about APIs others (or
they themselves) created.

Furthermore, not only is it natural for engineers to change their minds about
_how_ they want to achieve things, also customers, directors, and thus product
owners change their minds about _what_ they wantâ€”past plans are just that: plans
of the past. Under these conditions, you must be able to duck-tape a new
solutions using a existing codeâ€”again, ideally without running the risk of
introducing contradicting assumptions when composing APIs.

As always, _there are no solutions, there are only trade-offs._ Of course, you
could spin the above argument about types ad infinitum andâ€”figuratively
speakingâ€”insist on using Haskell (or whatever), and spend the rest of your days
discussing mind-boggling abstractions until your head spinsâ€”probably not a
winning strategy. However, what is remarkable to me at least is that Rust
managed to make the right trade-offs insofar as it almost _stormed_ the system
engineering space. For the first time, engineers have a practical alternative to
C[++] for security- and performance-critical applications, while, e.g., still
providing benefits in areas like web engineering, smart contracts, etc.,
typically confined to dynamically typed "high-level" languages.

Rust is not the last wordâ€”god forbid. But empirically speaking, as ugly as it
isâ€”and it is uglyâ€”, it definitively hit the nail on the head in some ways to be
extremely effective for a wide range of applications. But, don't take my word
for it ...

## Market Adoption

### Blockchain & Cryptography

The promises that blockchain- and web3-advocates make are generally overhyped.
But my interest here primarily concerns the engineering aspects, not the
business case. And, like it or not, many engineers with systems and security
engineering expertise were attracted to that space by combinations of genuine
interest in the technology, hype, money, etc. And all of them faced the same
problem: build, deliver and deploy secure and efficient components of a
distributed system that provides predictable, deterministic results.

The blockchain space is interesting insofar as many projects evolved exactly
around the time Rust stabilized. And the impact is clearly visible. For example,
while the first Ethereum client was written in golang, and the C++ client,
[aleth](https://github.com/ethereum/aleth) went nowhere, newer clients such as
[ParityEthereum](https://github.com/openethereum/parity-ethereum) were already
implemented in Rust (Parity since moved on to Polkdadot). Beyond that, almost
all later, major Blockchain projects and research foundations bet on Rust. To
name a few:

* [IOHK](https://github.com/input-output-hk),
* [Polkadot](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk),
* [ICP](https://github.com/dfinity/ic),
* [Near](https://github.com/near), and
* [Solana](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana).
* [MystenLabs](https://github.com/MystenLabs/)

Beyond traditional blockchain, there is a lot happening in the area of
zero-knowledge proofs. [MatterLabs](https://github.com/matter-labs) is mentioned
here just as an example.

### Systems engineering

This is a completely random, small set of examples of companies and projects
that adopted Rust for the mission-critical systems components. I provocatively
mention some projects that rewrote some of their services from golang to Rust.

* AWS chose Rust to implement [Firecracker](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/why-aws-loves-rust-and-how-wed-like-to-help/), a virtualization technology that allows the launch of lightweight micro-virtual machines (microVMs) in a fraction of a second.
* Meta decided to write their bazel-competitor [Buck2](https://buck2.build/) in Rust. The first one was written in Java.
* Meta is one of the companies that [endorses](https://engineering.fb.com/2022/07/27/developer-tools/programming-languages-endorsed-for-server-side-use-at-meta/) Rust in general. Quoting from the linked article: Â«[...] Thereâ€™s a rapidly increasing Rust footprint in our products and services, and weâ€™re committing to Rust long-term and welcome early adopters. [...]Â»
* Google started adopting Rust and they have some [insights](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/06/rust-fact-vs-fiction-5-insights-from-googles-rust-journey-2022.html) to share.
* Discord [rewrote](https://discord.com/blog/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust) their real-time push notification service in Rust.
* Data dog rewrote a lot of code in Rust and they even created their own async-runtime, [glommio](https://github.com/DataDog/glommio). Among other blog posts, two of their engineers shred their experience in this [talk](https://datadogon.datadoghq.com/episodes/datadog-on-rust/).
* Linkerd [rewrote](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2-proxy) their service-mesh reverse proxy in Rust.
* etc.

### Web

It is not surprising that Rust is being adopted in places where traditionally
C++ would have been used. However, its type system also shines in other areas.
[Yew](https://yew.rs/) and [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/) are two
frontend-frameworks that are similar to React and target webassembly. Both of them are in use by commercial companies.

### Operating Systems

Unsurprisingly, Operating Systems space got its fair share of Rust-love.
[Redox](https://www.redox-os.org/) comes to mind. Though, in my view,
applications using library operating systems like
[Hermit-OS](https://github.com/hermit-os/) are gonna become more interesting in
the coming years.

It is worth mentioning that, besides C, Rust is the _only_ programming language
that has a chance of being an
[accepted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_for_Linux) as a default
development language for the Linux kernel. This is also one of the main reason
why the GCC-team opted to create their own Rust-frontend.

## Concepts

# Sum types

_Together with product types (`struct`s and tuples), sum types allow for
**unambiguous** modeling of application state._

The key in the above sentence is Â«unambiguousÂ». Consider the following
enumeration that represents the state of a Job, that is either waiting for
execution, being processed or has finished with a result. Each state of a value
of type `JobState` has a well-defined meaning:

```rust
enum JobState<T> {
    Queued,
    Processing,
    Finished { result: T }
}
```

Here is a trivial example of how a value of type `JobState` could be
deconstructed:

```rust
fn print_job_state<T: Debug>(js: JobState<T>) {
    match js {
        Queued              => println!("job is queued"),
        Processing          => println!("job is being processed"),
        Finished { result } => println!("yay! we have a result: {:?}", result)
    }
}
```

Now, compare this to how this would be represented in golang:

```golang
const (
    Queued     = iota
    Processing
    Finished
)

struct JobState[T] {
    Result     *T   // possibly nil
    State      int
}
```

The `.Result` field could be set, even though the state indicates `Queued` or
`Processing`. Conversely, the result could be set to `nil`, even though `.State`
is set to `Finished` (`nil`-pointer propagation). As a result, one has to resort
to _informal conventions_ to ensure consistency across API-boundaries and _hope_
that the implementor of an API adheres to those conventions.

It's worth noting that algebraic data types (ADTs) first appeared in
strongly-typed functional languages ([Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/),
[Ocaml](https://ocaml.org/), [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/), ...) and then
made their way into [Swift](https://www.swift.org/),
[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/),
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), ... and
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## `Option<T>`

A canonical example of a sum type in Rust is
[`Option<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html), which is
used wherever absence of a value is possible:

```rust
pub enum Option<T> {
    None,
    Some(T),
}
```

Needless to say, Option-values are all over the place. A common situation is
when one wants to retrieve a value from a collection. Let's say, e.g., we have a
hash map `prefs` that we use to retrieve people's preferences based on their
name:

```rust
// Assume prefs is of type: HashMap<String, Prefs>
if let alice_prefs = prefs.get("Alice") {
    println!("Alice prefs are: {alice_prefs:?}")
} else {
    println!("Ohoh! Alice has no prefs!")
}
```

In the above example, `HashMap::get` returns a value of type `Option<&Prefs>`.
So, it returns a reference to the object _owned_ by the hash map (if we wanted
to own the value, we would need to move it out of the hash map using `.remove`).

Often times, we _assert statically_ that a value is actually contained in a
collection. In this case, we can just call
[`.unwrap()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.unwrap)
on the `Option` and use the contained value:

```rust
let alice_prefs = prefs.get("Alice").unwrap();
println!("Alice prefs are: {alice_prefs:?}")
```

The call to `.unwrap()` panics if the underlying value is `None`. In general,
there is no guarantee of course that the sought after value is actually
contained. But the key here is that a user of the API has no choice but to deal
with potential absence and the panic generally happens at the earliest (!)
possible point where a mistaken assumption is madeâ€”not somewhere downstream.

Compare this to the situation in golang:

```golang
prefs := make(map[string]Prefs)
// ...
alice_prefs := prefs["Alice"]
```

In the above example, if `"Alice"` is missing, `alice_prefs` is just initialized
to the zero-value of the struct and the value propagates happily throughout the
codeâ€”most of the time, not what we want.

> Note: Depending on the situation, it is preferrable to use `.expect("some
message")` instead of just `.unwrap()`. The given message will be included in
the panic message and provides further guidance in case of a panic. It also acts
as documentation on why a value is expected to be there.

### Intermezzo: `Option::<&T>::None == null`

This is a quick intermezzo regarding the all-farmous Â«zero-cost abstractionsÂ» in
Rust. In the above example, the call to
[`get`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html#method.get)
returns a `Option<&V>`, where `V` is the value type of the hash map. In this
case, and whenever `Option` just wraps a reference, there is no overhead
associated with using an option type at runtime. As a null-pointer is an invalid
reference in any case, the `None`-variant is simply represented as a
`null`-Pointer.

## CLI-Argument parsing: a more elaborate use case

In my not-so-humble view, the easy stuff is also easy in Rustâ€”but simpler(*). While
the hard stuff is becoming possible. And this section, I would like to discuss a
quick example of this, demonstrating another concrete use case of ADTs in rust:
CLI-argument parsing.

(*) Note: simple and easy are not the same thing.

ADTs are a good fit to represent abstract syntax trees (ASTs) in general. And in
Rust, one can reprsent the set of possible input arguments to a program as a
type. In other words: there is no need to figure out the structure of the parser
by reading program codeâ€”it is informed by the type declaration.

These days, the de-facto standard library in Rust to parse command line
arguments [`clap`](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/). There are alternatives,
but unless you have specific needs, just use clap.

It is possible to assemble the parser in a programmatic way using a builder
pattern. And in fact, this is what is happening any way. However, the clap
authors went through the pain of providing macro-annotations that create the
parser based upon a structure:

```rust
/// A simple program that takes an optional -v/--verbose argument and a
/// filename.
#[derive(Parser, Debug)]
#[command(version, about, long_about = None)]
struct Args {
    /// Verbose output.
    #[arg(short, long)]
    verbose: bool,
    
    // A simple positional argument ...
    /// The file to be processed.
    path: PathBuf,
}

fn main() {
    let cli = Args::parse();
}
```

In the above example, the function `parse()` acts as a _constructor_ of a value
of type `Args`. It either succeeds in doing so based on the command-line
arguments passed to the program or fails with an error message. In the latter
case, it would look something like this:

```text
error: the following required arguments were not provided:
  <PATH>

Usage: executable <PATH>

For more information, try '--help'.
```
